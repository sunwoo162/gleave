# Gleave Desktop

The Desktop target is the local execution host for Gleave. It packages the EEEE
API, SQLite state, ClaimLatch adapter, ISEOL project runtime, and the desktop
widget from `apps/eeee/app/desktop`.

Desktop owns the source of truth and the local AI/tool permissions. It exposes
the paired Mobile bridge; it does not upload the EEEE database or require a
hosted login.

The aggregate repository keeps the implementation under `apps/eeee` so the
kernel and desktop distribution can be tested together. This directory is the
deployment boundary for a future standalone `gleave-desktop` repository.

The embedded runtime is started from `apps/eeee/app/desktop`. Desktop owns the
SQLite database, EEEE/ISEOL runtime, ClaimLatch adapter, and Mobile bridge. The
development shell can be launched with `scripts/desktop-up.ps1` or
`gleave-desktop`; it starts the API on loopback and opens the EEEE widget in one
process.

The widget's EEEE input calls `POST /api/assistant/route`, then refreshes
`GET /api/desktop/state` so the selected Project Runtime, ClaimLatch
(`claimlatch-v0.2.0`) health, redacted lifecycle events, and connector state are
visible together. `POST /api/desktop/pairing/code` is the only Desktop action
needed to begin Mobile pairing. It returns a short-lived six-digit code, never
an access token; Mobile remains a remote client of Desktop.

To produce a Windows executable locally, install PyInstaller in the build
environment and run:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".\\apps\\eeee[desktop,desktop-build]"
.\scripts\build-desktop.ps1
```

The output is `build\desktop\GleaveDesktop.exe`. The executable still uses the
user's local `.gleave` data directory and provider configuration; packaging does
not add a hosted service or move secrets into the binary.

The packaged runtime can be smoke-tested without opening a window:

```powershell
build\desktop\GleaveDesktop.exe --self-test
```

Exit code `0` confirms that the embedded loopback API started and its health
endpoint returned `ok`.
