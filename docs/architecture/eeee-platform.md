# Gleave Architecture

`Gleave` is one local-first open-source project. EEEE, ISEOL, and ClaimLatch are internal parts of that project, not three products the user must operate separately.

## EEEE chooses the tool

EEEE is the top-level personal assistant. The request is not assumed to be a development request.

| User intent | EEEE capability | Connected tool |
|---|---|---|
| 일정, 약속, 알림, 루틴 | `personal-secretary` | Google Calendar / local scheduler |
| 앱, 서비스, 기능, 프로젝트 | `project-execution` | Project Runtime + ISEOL |
| 문서, 정보, 요약, 검색 | `knowledge-documents` | local files / memory |
| 문서, 결정, 진행 기록 | `knowledge-documents` | Notion adapter |
| 바탕화면, 휴대폰, 알림 | `presence` | Desktop widget / Mobile bridge |

Capabilities are registered through a descriptor and selected by the EEEE router. A new capability does not require adding another project-specific branch to the kernel.

## One project creation flow

`ProjectProvisioner` turns one natural-language request into one durable Project Runtime.

1. Issue a stable `projectId` and current `projectRevision`.
2. Parse goal, scope, constraints, schedule, acceptance criteria, and user preferences.
3. Retrieve matching EEEE memories and QA baselines.
4. Create the local workspace and Project Profile.
5. Compose the ISEOL project team and task decomposition policy.
6. Prepare Notion, Calendar, GitHub CI/Review, Desktop local host, and Mobile bridge plans.
7. Mark missing credentials as `awaiting_configuration`, never as completed.
8. Persist the profile, connector states, provenance, and idempotency keys in local SQLite.

Low-risk inferred values can be filled automatically. High-impact values such as public messages, deletion, deployment, or external writes remain planned until policy and ClaimLatch approval allow them.

## ISEOL project-execution loop

ISEOL is an internal Harness Coordinator, not a required Discord bot. It creates the Agent team, splits the work, routes tasks, runs integration and independent QA, and records the outcome for EEEE. Project specifications, decisions, and execution logs belong in the Notion project workspace.

## GitHub CI and code-review loop

For each configured repository ISEOL installs or verifies the review workflow, collects the CI artifact for the exact pull-request head revision, filters findings to changed lines, merges duplicate CI findings, and posts the review result back to GitHub. The result is recorded as project evidence and passed through independent QA and ClaimLatch before it can become EEEE memory. No Discord channel or bot notification is required.

```text
GitHub PR / CI artifact
        ↓ exact repository + PR + head SHA
ISEOL review collector
        ↓ changed-line filter + finding aggregation
GitHub inline review + review summary
        ↓
ISEOL independent QA + ClaimLatch + Release Gate
```

The bot can recommend or block a change, but a code-review PASS is not release approval. Release still requires deterministic QA evidence and a ClaimLatch result for the same `projectId` and revision; only that combined outcome may become EEEE project memory.

## ClaimLatch placement

ClaimLatch is a cross-cutting trust service, not another Agent and not only a final QA step.

- EEEE answer/report gate: verifies AI claims before presenting them as trusted.
- Action gate: verifies Notion, Calendar, GitHub, deployment, and message actions before side effects.
- ISEOL result gate: verifies Agent reports and outcome identity.
- Release gate: combines ClaimLatch, deterministic verification, and independent QA for one project/revision.
- Memory promotion gate: only a completed, independently verified, ClaimLatch-PASS outcome can create trusted memory.

ClaimLatch and deterministic QA answer different questions:

- ClaimLatch asks whether an AI claim or requested action satisfies evidence and policy.
- Deterministic QA asks whether the actual command, file, test, artifact, and revision prove the result.
- Release Gate requires both to agree on the same project identity and revision.

The platform integration profile is `claimlatch-v0.2.0`. Audit records also preserve the actual bundled engine version separately; this is currently `0.3.86` in `packages/claimlatch/package.json` and must be resolved explicitly in the release manifest.

## Local-first operation

The local EEEE process and SQLite database are the source of truth. No EEEE login or hosted control plane is required.

- Desktop is the default local control surface and the only source of truth.
- Mobile is a separately deployable remote client. It pairs to Desktop, forwards EEEE commands, and receives live state/events; it does not run the database, Agents, or ClaimLatch.
- Notion, Calendar, and GitHub are optional connectors using credentials supplied by the user. ISEOL is local and ready by default; Discord is not a core connector.
- Missing connectors remain inspectable as `planned` or `awaiting_configuration`.
- Connector operations use project identity, revision, audit events, and idempotency keys.

## Desktop/Mobile deployment boundary

Desktop and Mobile are separate deployment targets while remaining part of the
same Gleave product contract.

```text
Desktop
  ├─ EEEE API + SQLite + local memory
  ├─ ISEOL Agent execution + CI/review evidence
  ├─ ClaimLatch + deterministic QA + release gate
  └─ Mobile Bridge
       ├─ short-lived pairing code
       ├─ hashed device token
       ├─ remote assistant command
       └─ SSE live events
              ▲
              │ paired local network / approved tunnel
Mobile ───────┘ thin remote client
```

Project documents and review evidence are durable Desktop records. Notion sync
uses `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/documents/sync`; ISEOL review delivery uses
`POST /api/projects/{projectId}/evidence/github-review` with the versioned
`github-review-result.v1` contract. Both external writes pass through the
ClaimLatch trust boundary before persistence or provider execution.

The Mobile client calls `POST /api/mobile/assistant/route` for the same EEEE
secretary and project capabilities available on Desktop, reads
`GET /api/mobile/state` for the current snapshot, and subscribes to
`GET /api/mobile/events/stream` for live progress. Pairing is local and
user-initiated; the Desktop never exposes its provider tokens or database to
Mobile.
