# EEEE Unified Platform Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans (recommended for this task). Steps use checkbox syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Safely combine EEEE, ISEOL, and ClaimLatch into one local-first monorepo and implement the three critical links: ClaimLatch Adapter, EEEE persistent memory, and ISEOL independent QA results flowing into EEEE memory.

**Architecture:** Create a new eeee-platform monorepo while preserving the three existing repositories unchanged. Put EEEE under apps/eeee, ISEOL under packages/iseol, ClaimLatch under packages/claimlatch, and cross-runtime adapters/contracts under integrations. Keep Python and TypeScript dependency graphs separate and communicate through versioned local contracts.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLite, Pydantic, pytest; Node.js >=20, TypeScript, npm, Node test runner; ClaimLatch package currently reports version 0.3.86 even though its source folder is named claimlatch-v0.2.0; GitHub CLI for final publication.

**Spec:** C:/Users/user/Documents/EEEE/docs/architecture/eeee-iseol-claimlatch-organization.md

## Global Constraints

- Preserve the three existing folders; never delete, reset, or overwrite them.
- Build the unified checkout at C:/Users/user/Documents/eeee-platform.
- Do not copy .env files, credentials, node_modules, virtual environments, local databases, logs, caches, temporary workspaces, or generated build output.
- EEEE owns personal/project memory and user approval. ISEOL owns every Agent lifecycle, decomposition, routing, execution, handoff, integration, QA orchestration, and Agent evaluation.
- ClaimLatch verifies natural-language claims and release reports. Deterministic verification remains responsible for code, files, commands, tests, and runtime behavior.
- Required verification failures fail closed.
- Core operation is local-first and does not require a hosted login or central server.
- Pin the ClaimLatch source commit/version used by the adapter.

## Review Focus

- Sanitized repository import must exclude secrets, generated output, and nested Git histories; Task 1 tests the import manifest.
- Cross-runtime reports must be versioned and revision-bound; Task 2 tests schemas, correlation IDs, idempotency, and stale revisions.
- ClaimLatch failure or missing evidence must never release a trusted report or memory rule; Task 3 tests fail-closed behavior.
- One noisy lesson must not become a global Playbook rule; Task 4 tests candidate/active memory states, provenance, scope, conflicts, and promotion.
- QA must inspect the newest integrated revision and produce evidence rather than trusting Agent completion text; Task 5 tests independent QA and the memory handoff.

- [ ] Record git rev-parse HEAD, git remote -v, git status --short, and git ls-files for all three sources.
- [ ] Copy only tracked source, tests, docs, licenses, package metadata, and the EEEE architecture document; exclude .git, .env, node_modules, .venv, dist, tmp, logs, caches, runtime data, and local databases.
- [ ] Add repository-manifest.json with schemaVersion 1 and all three source records.
- [ ] Add a repository check that detects nested Git directories, secret-like files, missing package roots, and missing source metadata.
- [ ] Run the repository check and git diff --check.
- [ ] Commit with chore: create unified EEEE platform repository.

### Task 2: Define versioned EEEE-ISEOL-QA contracts

- [ ] Write failing tests for missing identifiers, unsupported versions, mismatched revisions, duplicate artifacts, invalid statuses, and reports without verification metadata.
- [ ] Implement Pydantic and TypeScript runtime validators with explicit schema-version rejection.
- [ ] Require requestId and projectRevision on every cross-boundary message.
- [ ] Make replay of an identical report idempotent and reject reports for older revisions.

- [ ] Write failing tests for PASS, BLOCK, unsupported claims, missing evidence, malformed reports, provider errors, structured actions outside allowlists, and receipt linkage.
- [ ] Pin the actual ClaimLatch package version and source commit. Do not infer version from the folder name.
- [ ] Use ClaimLatch verifyBeforeRelease for textual results and expose only a controlled loopback/process boundary to Python.
- [ ] Add the structured-output policy layer for workspace paths, tool allowlists, external transfer, delete, publish, deploy, and message-send actions.
- [ ] Persist ClaimLatch report ID, receipt ID, payload hash, policy version, adapter version, ClaimLatch version, and project revision.
- [ ] Make transport errors, verifier errors, and missing evidence fail closed.
- [ ] Add release hooks for Agent handoffs, QA summaries, final reports, and memory candidates.
- [ ] Run adapter tests and commit with feat: add local ClaimLatch release adapter.

### Task 4: Implement EEEE persistent memory and promotion

**Priority:** P0

**Files:**
- Create: apps/eeee/app/memory/models.py
- Create: apps/eeee/app/memory/store.py
- Create: apps/eeee/app/memory/compiler.py
- Create: apps/eeee/app/memory/retriever.py

- MemoryStore.revoke(memory_id, reason) -> MemoryRecord.
- MemoryRetriever.search(query, scope, filters) -> list[MemoryRecord].
- MemoryCompiler.compile(outcome_report) -> list[MemoryCandidateV1].

- [ ] Write failing tests for candidate/active/superseded/revoked states, provenance, project scope, duplicate reports, conflicts, expiry, and user deletion.
- [ ] Add SQLite migrations for memory records separate from raw events.
- [ ] Require source project, source artifacts, verification IDs, scope, confidence meaning, timestamps, and optional expiry.
- [ ] Compile successful patterns, failed patterns, QA rules, regression rules, Agent routing hints, and Playbook proposals from ProjectOutcomeReportV1.
- [ ] Keep compilation separate from promotion; no candidate becomes active automatically without policy.
- [ ] Require ClaimLatch evidence for external factual rules and deterministic evidence for code/QA rules.
- [ ] Require explicit user approval or repeated validated evidence for organization-wide Playbook rules.
- [ ] Implement scoped retrieval by project type, technology, feature, risk, recency, verification status, and user approval.
- [ ] Run memory tests and commit with feat: add persistent project memory and promotion pipeline.

- EvidenceLedger.record(evidence) -> EvidenceId.
- ReleaseGate.evaluate(qaReport, deterministicReport, verificationEnvelope) -> PASS | WARN | BLOCKED.
- MemoryCompiler.compile(verifiedOutcomeReport) -> MemoryCandidateV1 list.

- [ ] Write failing tests for QA-0 through QA-5, required evidence, latest-revision checks, stale report rejection, and Agent completion text being insufficient.
- [ ] Represent acceptance criteria, risk, required checks, inherited regression rules, and release thresholds as structured QA data.
- [ ] Reuse the existing deterministic EEEE harness verifier and ISEOL evidence instead of creating a second unrestricted command runner.
- [ ] Record command, exit status, stdout/stderr hash, workspace, revision, artifact paths, and verification IDs for every check.
- [ ] Return findings with severity, reproduction steps, evidence IDs, owner Workstream, and required action.
- [ ] Route blocking findings back to ISEOL without changing them into memory.
- [ ] After QA passes, create ProjectOutcomeReportV1 and send it through ClaimLatch before memory compilation.
- [ ] Compile QA failures and successes into candidates, but only promote them through Task 4 policy.
- [ ] Add a test proving Project A’s validated responsive defect becomes Project B’s QA baseline without importing raw unverified text.
- [ ] Run Python and TypeScript QA tests and commit with feat: connect independent QA to persistent memory.

- Modify: apps/eeee/app/coordinator/service.py
- Test: apps/eeee/tests/coordinator/test_memory_project_flow.py

- [ ] Test a previous responsive defect creating a required viewport check, a successful API/DB sequencing pattern creating a dependency, and a small project collapsing unnecessary parallel teams.
- [ ] Model Role, Workstream, Team, Agent Instance, Task, capability, permissions, and performance separately.
- [ ] Retrieve scoped EEEE memory before dispatch and preserve memory IDs in the generated ProjectBrief and QaPlan.
- [ ] Keep ISEOL as the sole owner of Agent creation, routing, handoff, retry, integration, and evaluation.
- [ ] Run cross-runtime tests and commit with feat: make ISEOL planning memory-aware.

### Task 7: Add local runtime, security checks, and end-to-end proof

**Files:**
- Create: scripts/dev-up.ps1
- Create: scripts/verify-all.ps1
- Create: docs/operations/local-runtime.md
- Create: docs/security/trusted-release-boundary.md
- Create: tests/e2e/test_project_memory_qa_loop.ps1
- Copy/update: docs/architecture/eeee-iseol-claimlatch-organization.md

- [ ] Start EEEE, ISEOL, and ClaimLatch only on loopback with health checks.
- [ ] Verify workspace path boundaries, command allowlists, no-secret import, external network policy, structured action allowlists, receipt permissions, and approval requirements.
- [ ] Run one local fixture through request, memory retrieval, ISEOL plan, Agent evidence, independent QA, ClaimLatch final report, memory candidate, and next-project QA baseline.
- [ ] Run scripts/verify-all.ps1 and require Python tests, TypeScript tests, adapter tests, contract tests, repository hygiene, and the end-to-end loop to pass.
- [ ] Commit with test: verify local EEEE ISEOL ClaimLatch workflow.

### Task 8: Publish the aggregate GitHub repository

**Default target:** sunwoo162/eeee-platform, public. Keep this configurable until the final creation command.

**Files:**
- Modify: eeee-platform/README.md with setup, component map, verification commands, and upstream attribution.
- Create: eeee-platform/.github/workflows/verify.yml

- [ ] Run the full verification and secret scan before any remote creation.
- [ ] Create the repository with gh repo create only after the local initial commit passes.
- [ ] Push main and attach the created repository artifact.
- [ ] Record all three upstream remotes and imported commits in repository-manifest.json.
- [ ] Leave the original repositories preserved as reference/upstream checkouts unless the user later chooses a migration policy.

## Self-Review Results

- Spec coverage: repository consolidation, EEEE/ISEOL ownership, dynamic Agent organization, independent QA, ClaimLatch integration, persistent memory, memory-informed next-project QA, local runtime, and GitHub aggregation are covered.
- Priority coverage: ClaimLatch Adapter, EEEE memory lifecycle, and ISEOL QA-to-memory flow are explicit P0 tasks.
- Fail-closed coverage: ClaimLatch failure, stale revisions, missing evidence, structured action violations, and untrusted memory promotion have dedicated tests.
- Known deferred scope: full calendar, communications, and life-management automation remain after the first vertical project-memory/QA loop.
- No destructive migration: existing folders remain unchanged and the new aggregate repository becomes authoritative only after verification.

## Execution Handoff

The plan is complete and saved to docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-06-eeeee-unified-platform.md. Review it before implementation begins. Native execution with one final independent review is recommended because the P0 tasks share cross-language contracts and persistence boundaries.
